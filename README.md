Graceful degradation and service workers are related in the context of web development strategies aimed at enhancing user experience and maintaining functionality across different environments. Graceful degradation focuses on starting with the most advanced technology and gracefully handling the absence or limitations of that technology in older or less capable environments. Service workers, on the other hand, are a crucial component for creating Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that offer offline functionality, background synchronization, and improved performance. When implementing graceful degradation, developers can use service workers to ensure that essential features of their web applications remain available even when certain technologies or capabilities are not supported by the user's browser or device.
